# MTest: Unit Test Framework in Magma

This project was done for a class, CS 448H, with Prof. Pat Hanrahan. The work here has been
summarized in the paper [mtest](parimarjan.github.io/papers/mtest.pdf).

Right now, the combinatorial circuits appear to test reliably. 

## Setup
You will need a FPGA, like the lattice icestick. Follow the instructions for installing magma and
other required tools [here](https://github.com/rdaly525/CS448H).

## Demos

Plug in the icestick, and run any of the files like add3_mtest.py to see a sample.
In these files, we provide input/output test files, which are saved in /testing
folder.
